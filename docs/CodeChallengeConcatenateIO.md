# Concatenate.io Code Challenge: Knockout Round 
In this code challenge you should create a USSD application that is able to send airtime as well as an SMS notification confirming the airtime has been sent. You can add more functionality to the USSD application. You can add more levels to your USSD application with any functionality based on our APIs or other services.

In the SMS front, the response that the user gets is a two-way SMS that allows you to get feedback from the user regarding the service provided. Try make it as conversational as possible.

Remember that the code you use on this code challenge will inform the next round. 


### Task Workflow:
1. User initiates the USSD application
2. Your app responds with the various options among them being the Airtime 
3. The user enters the amount of airtime that needs to be sent 
4. Once sent, a confirmation SMS is sent to the user.
5. The SMS is two way. You should have an interaction asking the user for feedback on the service.
5. Ensure your service is accessible online. You can use the free tiers of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) or other platform of choice
